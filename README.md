# Sum of Array Elements â€“ JavaScript Logic Project

This is a beginner-friendly JavaScript project that calculates the **sum of all numbers in an array** using a `for` loop. The result is displayed in the **browser console**.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. An array of numbers is declared.
2. A `sum` variable is initialized to 0.
3. A `for` loop runs through each index of the array.
4. On each iteration, the current value is added to `sum`.
5. The final sum is logged to the console.
